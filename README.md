# Learning-to-Classify-Logical-Formulas-based-on-their-Semantic-Similarity
Repository containing code used for the experiments found in the paper titled "Learning to Classify Logical Formulas based on their Semantic Similarity" submitted to PRIMA

Logic, and Logic random sampling python files can be used to prodce new datasets. We already include the datasets/formulas we used for each universe.

After choosing the dataset please use the process formulas ML python file to test performance by applying different ML methods.
